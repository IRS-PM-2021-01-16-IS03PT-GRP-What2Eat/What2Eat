 Clean and remove excess hair form the belly. Using a shape knife (utility/pen knife works wonder), make scores about centimeter apart through the skin into the fat in a criss-cross pattern, throughout the whole skin surface. Do not cut into the meat.
 This is optional but if you are really into roast belly, I suggest that you get one of these traditional nail-bed tools to make multiple holes evenly on the skin (in addition to the score).
 Rub salt right into the scores. Brush off any excess salt from the skin and flip the meat over. Season evenly the underside of the belly with salt and black pepper.
 Leave the piece of marinated meat in the open, preferably some where windy. My trick is to place a blowing fan directly in front of the belly for hours. Scoring and drying the skin will reward you with the crispy crackling of a good belly roast.
 Preheat the oven at 220 �C.
 Place the pork belly, skin side-up, in a roasting tray (big enough to hold the belly and all the vegetable) and place in the hot oven for half an hour until the skin of the pork starts to puff up, turning into crackling.
 Lower the temperature to 180 �C and roast for another hour.
 Remove the belly from the oven. Carefully lift the belly up and transfer to a chopping board. Pour the oil from the belly into a container.
 Add all the vegetable to the tray. Place the pork belly on top of the vegetable and return the tray to the oven and roast at the same temperature for another hour. By this time, the meat should be meltingly soft and tender and the skin crispy.
 Serve immediately.

 Pinch about 8-10 grams of the dough, shape it round, and lightly press using the thumb to form a cavity.

 Prepare the steamer on high heat.
 In a large mixing bowl, add minced pork, water chestnuts, soy sauce, Shao Xing wine, sugar, white pepper, corn flour, and sesame oil.
 Using a pair of chopstick, mix ingredients in one direction until well combined.
 Place meat mixture on a stainless steel plate or heat-safe plate, make a slight dent in the middle, and place the salted fish in the dent.
 Distribute ginger on top of salted fish and meat.
 Steam on high for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked. (This depends on the thickness of your meat. My patty was about an inch in thickness.)

 Mixing the meat in one direction breaks down the molecules in the protein, which cause the meat to bind, produce a springy texture, and the meat will not fall apart when steamed.',20);

 A handful of chopped fresh coriander','http://mysingaporefood.com/recipe/chicken-curry-muthu-style/','Methods
 
 
 Marinade:
 
 
 Marinate chicken pieces with ginger, garlic, tumeric and tomato. (Do not cut the tomato, crush it with your fingers)
 Keep in fridge for 2-3 hours. 
 
 
 To Cook: 
 
 
 Heat � cup of oil in a cooking pot
 When hot, throw in the mix seeds, lemon grass and blue ginger. 
 Add the cardamom, star anis and cinnamon stick.
 Add in the onions and fry till soft. There must be a substantial amount of oil to fry the onions. 
 Add in the coriander powder, BABAs meat curry powder and fresh chili paste. Keep stirring as the powder is likely to burn at the bottom of the pot. If it gets too dry, add in a little water and keep stirring. If you like it to be spicy, you can add the chilli powder at this point. 
 You should also add in the salt (according to your taste) at this stage.
 Once you start to see the oil separating from the onions, its time to add in the chicken.
 Add the chicken to the mixture and stir to ensure the chicken is well coated with the onion mixture.
 Cover pot and leave on a low fire to cook. Remember to stir the chicken every 15 minutes so that the powders do not burn at the bottom of the pot. Do not add water as the water from the chicken will be enough for it to cook. 
 Once the chicken is cooked, remove lid and put the fire on medium heat until the water is all dried.
 Once again, you should see the oil separating from the chicken mixture. This is a signal that the onions are well cooked. You may want to taste the chicken to ensure that all the spices and salt are enough.
 Once the taste is perfect, add in a little hot water. This is for the gravy. Remember, it shouldnt be too thick nor too watery. 
 Give it one boil and switch off the fire. 
 Garnish with coriander and serve with rice / chappati / naan!',21);

 Turn heat to high and bring water to boil in a pot.
 Add pasta into the pot. Stir continuously till it comes to a gentle rolling boil.
 Cook as per instructions on the pasta packet, taking 1 minute off the recommended time.
 Heat up frying pan on high.
 Add vegetable oil, enough to cover base of the pan.
 Turn heat to low. Add garlic and chilli. Saute till the edges on the garlic turn golden brown.
 Add kana chai. Mix well and add a pinch of salt.
 Turn off heat, then add shallots.
 Set the pan next to the pasta pot. Turn the heat to high.
 Transfer the pasta with a pair of tongs directly into the pan, letting the high heat in the pan create an emulsion with the pasta.
 Lightly toss the pasta in the sauce, coating every bit evenly.
 If it is looking a bit dry, add a spoonful of pasta water into the pan.
 Turn off the heat. Add soy sauce.
 Serve immediately with a fried egg on top.

 * The following is my way of frying. You definitely can fry it your way.
 
 
 Heat up your wok. Add dried shrimps to remove residue water and prevent splatter. Push aside. 
 Heat up some cooking oil in the same wok. Return the dried shrimps to the hot oil.
 Fry till very fragrant (important). Dish up without the oil.
 In the same wok, fry the minced meat till dry and slightly brown. Dish up.
 In the same wok, add some oil. Stir-fry the black fungus a while. Prepare to take cover! Dish up.
 In the same wok, heat up some cooking oil. Add turnips and carrots and stir-fry over high heat for about 5 minutes. Lower the heat. 
 Add salt and sesame oil. Mix well. 
 Add black fungus, minced meat and dried shrimps, pork lard if using. Mix thoroughly. Adjust taste accordingly to your preferred taste. 
 Drizzle some more sesame oil if you want. Remove to a big bowl and let it cool completely before serving.
 
 
 Preparing the dough (by stand mixer):
 
 
 Add rice flour, tapioca flour, salt and sugar together. Mix well. If possible, sieve the dry ingredients.
 Transfer the dry ingredients in the mixer bowl. Drizzle 3 drops colouring. Switch on your mixer on low speed.
 Add in the hot water along the edges as the dough hook is mixing.
 Use a rubber spatula to scrape the side of the mixing bowl to bring the lumpy flour closer to the dough hook. Mix the flour and water till smooth.
 Add in the oil. Mix till incorporated.
 Transfer the semi-cooked dough to a floured work top.
 Give a few knead to smoothen the dough. If sticky, sprinkle some reserve flour.
 Divide dough into equal portion. Cover with a cloth to prevent the dough from drying. Rolled into oval shape. Make a well in the centre of the dough like a nest.
 Using your thumb and index finger, widen the nest, thinning the edges and sides as you go along. Leave a thickness of about 0.5 mm at the bottom.
 Fill the nest with your fillings. Overlap the left and right flap to close the dough. Set aside. Continue with the rest of the dough.
 Arrange the shaped kueh on a greased tray. Steam in a wok with rapid boiling water on high heat for 12 minutes or till cooked. 
 Serve hot or cold over a cup of piping hot MILO.

 Steam the yam in a tray for about 30 to 40 minutes or till soft with some liquid oozing out.
 Remove from steamer and mash it till smooth while hot.
 Next, steam the pumpkin till soft. Remove from steamer and mash it till smooth while hot.
 Steam the sugar-soaked gingko nuts till the nuts will look slightly puffed up. Remove from steamer drain.
 Heat the wok with oil. Fry the sliced shallots till fragrant. You will need to collect quite a fair bit of oil for later use. Scoop up the fried shallots for other use. We need the oil only.
 Pour the mashed yam into the same wok and fry on medium heat. Add the shallots oil when it starts to dry. Do not let it get burnt.
 Move the wok away from the stove each time sugar is added to prevent the sugar from getting burnt. Then put it back on the stove again. The heat will melt the sugar into the paste and at same time avoid being burnt. Do this a few times till u get your desired texture and sweetness level.
 Turn off the heat and scoop into individual bowls. Serve with pumpkin puree and gingko nuts. 
 Cook in a small saucepan some coconut milk and add a pinch of salt. This can be used as a drizzle when serving.

 In a saucepan, add (1b-146g water) with salt together. Keeping the fire on low, gently heat up the water.
 Sieve the mixture in Step 2 to another bowl to remove any lumps (I use a stand mixer).
 Once the saucepan of water has been gently heated, remove it from the stove. Scoop a small ladle of mixture in Step 2 and add it in Step 3, stirring constantly.
 Pour Step 5 into Step 2, stirring constantly to ensure an even mix.
 Pour the semi-cooked mixture into an oiled stainless steel pan.
 Steam at medium high heat for 1 hour with a foil covering the pan to prevent water vapour from dripping onto the kueh.
 Insert a skewer to the centre of the kueh to test whether it has set. 
 Cool completely and refrigerate for at least 12 hour or overnight.
 Cut into small rectangular shape with a thickness of about 0.5 mm. Set aside for frying.
