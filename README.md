## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

A panoply of considerations go into choosing the meals we partake in each day. These could include the nutritional value of dishes, as well as the taste, dietary and budgetary preferences of an individual for that particular meal. More often than not, we find ourselves overwhelmed with the plethora of available food choices, making it extremely difficult to decide upon a dish with absolute conviction, a circumstance commonly known as ‘choice paralysis’. 

What2Eat aims to streamline this decision process by leveraging Intelligent Systems to recommend dishes tailored to users’ palates. This is done through understanding and recognizing their taste and dietary preferences, as well as their current mood which is known to be closely associated with food cravings. Understanding that taste preferences often alters over time, the solution accepts ratings from the users, ensuring that the recommendation remains optimized and relevant.
